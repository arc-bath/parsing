The repository contains exercises based around parsing datasets in a file, to design a function `read_structs(filename)` which:

1. Reads in and process a data file containing a number of atomic structures
2. If the line begins with `##` there are no more structures
3. If the line begins with `**` that is the end of the current structure
4. Otherwise the line consists of `<Element label>  <x_coordinate>  <y_coordinate>  <z_coordinate>`
5. The element label should be read into `elements`, a list of list so that each can be accessed with [ <structure_no> ][ <element_no> ] 
6. The coordinates should be read in `x`, `y`, `z` lists of lists with the same structure as for elements.
7. The coordinates should be converted to floats.
8. Your function should check that it is correctly terminated (by `##`) raising an exception error if it doesn't.
9. Your function should count the number of elements in each structure and store these in a list, if any other elements/positions cannot be converted the structure should be marked as invalid.
10. Your function should count the number of valid and invalid structures.
11. Finally your function should return:
    ```python
    return [ valid_structs,
             [ invalid structs, [ list_of_invalid_structs ] ],
             [ elements_per_struct ],
             [[ elements ]],
             [[ x ]] , [[ y ]], [[ z ]] ]
    ```

The repository consists of a set of tests `test_parsing.py` and prototype functions `parsing.py`.  The students aim to write functions to satisfy the tests.

More detailed instructions about this exercise are available in the [Now Code lesson](https://arc-bath.github.io/now-code/02-parsing.html).
